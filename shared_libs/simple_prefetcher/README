This prefetcher will, for each opened regular file, start a pthread which does READAHEAD/PREAD_RA for a given size(NR_RA_PAGES)


Compiled Libraries:
libsimpleprefetcher.so: starts a pthread for each regular file opened. Does Readahead on them
libsimplenoprefetcher.so: Doest start pthread. Just does shim [test overheads]
