Experimental Setting

Node:
c220g5
Total Mem = 198 GB
Nr Cores = 40
Ramdisk = 130GB


IOR:
writing to SATA-SSD
Total File size = 120GB
ReadSize = 1MB

SetRA = 2097152 blocks (262144 pages)


Experimental Idea:
The idea of this experiment is to see how application Bandwidth changes when increasing number of mpi procs given a single IOR and SETRA setting.

We chose SetRA value to be above because when we keep corecount constant and increase the RAsize, Bandwidth percieved by IOR reduces at this point. (plots/Bandwidth_v_RAsize/ssd-c220g5/original_linux) 


In these experiments the available disposable memory for file cache is around 60GB, half the total file size, increasing the RAsize would pollute the cache and reduce bandwidth

With the two experiments we wanted to show the following:
1. Default static values for different OS parameters may not provide the best performance.
2. Setting extreme static values for OS parameters might hurt performance.
3. Ideal OS parameters should be chosen Based on the current system scenario (disposable memory, disk load, app procs/threads etc).
4. Hence static values cannot be used, OS parameters should be dynamic since system scenario changes over time.
