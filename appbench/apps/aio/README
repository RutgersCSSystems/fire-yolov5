Explanation of different binaries generated by make

read_onlyospfetch - This is a single thread doing sequential reads to i
bigfakefile.txt using pread syscall. No pthreads are spawned. 
OS internal prefetching is enabled

read_noprefetch - Same as above with OS internal prefetching disabled

read_onlyaiopfetch - Master thread reads the file sequentially using pread syscall
slave thread prefetches the file asynchronously using aio. OS internal prefetching is disabled

read_os_aiopfetch - Same as above with both aio and OS prefetching enabled.

dont_read_os_aiopfetch - Doesnt use master thread for anything. Uses slave thread to just read the whole file using aio.
