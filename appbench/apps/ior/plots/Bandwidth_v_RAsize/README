Experimental Setting:

Original Linux:
1. 2MB limit on fadvice is enabled (default)
2. max_hw_sectors_kb is set to 1280 KB (default)

Modified Linux:
1. 2MB limit on fadvice is disabled
2. max_hw_sectors_kb is set to INT_MAX


Cloudlab node c220g5@wisc is used for this experiment:
1. Processors = 40
2. DRAM = 200 GB

Configuration:
1. Ramdisk size = 130 GB (To restrict available memory for page cache)
2. App prediction enable/disable
3. RAsize increasing

IOR config:
1. NP = 32
2. Sequential read with per proc file
3. Total file size = 120 GB


script used ior/variation_testing.sh : it generates a dat file for GNUPLOT


==============================================
The idea here is to see the max bandwidth while memory is scarce
