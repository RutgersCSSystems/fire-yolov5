Increase the size of run (water_MD.mdp)
nsteps, dt,

To change frequency of writes look at water_MD.mdp
nstxout, nstvout, nstfout, nstlog, nstenergy, nstxtcout

after each changing *.mdp files, one needs to run:
gmx grompp -v -f water_MD.mdp -c water.gro -p water.top -o run_water

-------------------------
To clean the newly written logs and files: ./clean_out.sh

WARNING: To clean all the files, including essentials: ./cleanup.sh

If you cleanup and dont know how to get back to run the program
$./setup.sh

It so migh happen that you have compiled your own gromacs and tried setup.sh
In these cases, change the SPC path to : <gromacsSourcePath>/share/...
