mpiexec -n $NO_PROC MADbench2.x $NO_PIX $NO_BIN $NO_GANG $SBLOCKSIZE $FBLOCKSIZE $RMOD $WMOD $STRIDE

Parameters
NO_PIX      Sets the size of the pseudo-data - all the component matrices have NO_PIX x NO_PIX elements
NO_BIN      Sets the size of the pseudo-dataset - there are NO_BIN component matrices
NO_GANG     Sets the level of gang-parallelism - there are NO_GANG gangs
SBLOCKSIZE  Sets the ScaLAPACK blocksize - all matrices will be block-cycically distributed with side SBLOCKSIZE.
FBLOCKSIZE  Sets the file blocksize - all IO will start at a file-offset that is an integer multiple of FBLOCKSIZE.
RMOD        Sets the degree of simultaneous reading - 1:RMOD processors will read at once.
WMOD        Sets the degree of simultaneous writing - 1:WMOD processors will write at once.
FLUSH       Flush after each write operation

Additional environment variables
IOMETHOD  = POSIX | MPI
IOMODE    = SYNC | ASYNC
FILETYPE  = UNIQUE | SHARED
REMAP     = CUSTOM | SCALAPACK
BWEXP     = Any number

Modifications Made to MADBench:
1. I have converted all busy_work to NOP; this removes unnecessary CPU usage which
increases runtime. (#ifdef COMPUTE)
2. I have removed second time writing to file in calc_W. (#ifdef W_WRITE)
3. Write file if it doesnt exist else only read
