# config/suite.def
# This file is used to build several benchmarks with a single command. 
# Typing "make suite" in the main directory will build all the benchmarks
# specified in this file. 
# Each line of this file contains a benchmark name and the class.
# The name is one of "cg", "is", "ep", mg", "ft", "sp",
#  "bt", "lu", and "ua". 
# The class is one of "E", "W", "A" through "E"
