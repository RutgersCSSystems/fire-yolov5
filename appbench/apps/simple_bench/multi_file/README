It has been observed (using lock_stat) that when multiple worker threads try to readahead
from a single shared file to improve prefetching performance, it increases the total
read time from the main thread primarily due to locking contention on xarray etc.


This simple benchmark will test this hypothesis.

it will do so by dividing the big shared file into small private files(=NR_WORKERS)
main thread would read from a given file based on the offset.
