This is a simple write/read program that does sequential reads


Compile Time Flags and their meanings

ONLYAPP - Disables OS prefetching
ONLYOS - Disables Any pread_ra or readahead or fadvise from application, only OS prefetching enabled
READRA - APP prefetching is done using pread_ra
APP_NATIVE_RA - APP prefetching is done using readahead syscall
FILESZ - Compile time defined File size. If none is provided, 10GB will be default (change it in Makefile)

When no compile time flags are given, read.c will just open "bigfakefile.txt" and read it
